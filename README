Nifty Electrode Mapper
======================
The Nifty Electrode Mapper (NEM)is a member of the Nifty Visualization Toolbox
that enables manual placement and arrangement of visual electrode, or channel,
markers onto three-dimensional surface rendering of brain.

This tool was designed to ease the planning and mapping of electrode topography
onto patient brain and specifically caters to the interests of researchers
and clinicians.

INSTALLATION
============
The Nifty Visualization Toolbox and all accompanying tools are developed in
python. OS compatability includes Linux, MAC OS X, and Microsoft Windows with
the following additional requirements:

    # Python 3
        - Unsupported

    # Python 2.7
        -  The following external packages need to be included in the default
        python path:
            * NumPy (Ver 2.0)
            * SciPy (Ver 0.11)
            * wxPython (Ver 2.8)
            * NiBabel (Ver 1.1)

USAGE
=====
NEM currently contains a no-frills, simplistic work environment. Features are
subject to change as the software proceeds in development.

Currently, only NIfTI (*.nii) file-types are supported.

    Initializing NEM from command-line:
        $ python NiftyElecMap.py "path-to-nii-file.nii"

NEM will start with a three-dimensional environment with specified brain volume
rendered at the center of the window. 

    Mouse Functionality:
        - Left-click --- Rotation
        - Right-click --- Zooming and Scaling
        - Middle-click --- Position/Place electrode channel marker
        - Right-click (while above a marker) --- Remove marker representation

Once electrode channels have been positioned, user can simply take a screenshot
of the rendered brain using the "Print Screen" key.
